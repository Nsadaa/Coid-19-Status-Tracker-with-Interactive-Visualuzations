# Coid-19-Status-Tracker-with-Interactive-Visualuzations

## Introduction
This is a mini projects about Live Covid 19 data analysis &amp; interactive visualization by using python in both global &amp; Sri Lanka's situation.In here mainly used plotly for interactive & creative data visualizations instead of usual matplotlib & seaborn libraries. In every time we run the notebook we can get updated data insights. ( *The live data source that we use in here is fully update the data after two days in each corresponding days* )

##### Special Note 
*To keep the accuracy of the data inights, i have to perform data analysis & visualizaions on two days before the current date*

## Objectives
- Use python for better & insghitful data analysis & visualizatins.
- Use Pandas advance data analysis techniques to data cleaning & manipulations of the raw data.
- Use Geospatial visualization to make better understand about the derived insights of the raw data.
- use plotly to plot customized , creative & interactive visualization better than usual matplotlib & seaborn.

## How to Use

##### In Google Colaboratory ( Highly Recommend )
- Make Copy of the Coid 19 Status Tracker with Interactive Visualuzations.ipynb to the google colaboratory
- Make copy of the Provied World Countries Geospatial Boundaries Shape files to your google cloud folder.
- Copy file path ( WB_countries_Admin0_10m.shp llocated in above files copied location in you google drive ) to the geopandas as the path adress in Coid 19 Status Tracker with Interactive Visualuzations.ipynb.
- Run Coid 19 Status Tracker with Interactive Visualuzations.ipynb in goole colab.
